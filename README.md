# SUs-Extractor
The "SUs Extractor" script is designed to extract data from the AIESEC Global Information System (GIS) API, specifically focusing on retrieving information about Sign-Up (SU) applicants. The `myFunction()` initiates the process by first determining the total number of pages of data available through the API, logging this information for reference. It then proceeds to invoke `liveUpdating(total)`, which iteratively fetches data from each page using the `dataExtraction(page)` function. For each retrieved SU record, it checks for duplicates in the "LIVE" spreadsheet based on the ID, updates relevant information such as contact details, academic backgrounds, program preferences, and organizational alignments if not already present. Finally, it appends the extracted data into the spreadsheet, ensuring data integrity and completeness for further analysis or operational use within AIESEC.
